# Sketch Plugin: Retain Text Color

This plugin retains the original color of text layers when applying a Text Style.

### But why do I need this?

So often when defining text styles for a shared library, there's a number of different sizes, font weights, and more. Once you've defined all of these they need to be duplicated for each color variant that may apply.

By removing the color override from text styles (or at least re-applying the original color) the need to define this plethora of styles is removed.

## Installation

- [Download](../../releases/latest/download/sketch-retain-text-color.sketchplugin.zip) the latest release of the plugin
- Un-zip
- Double-click on sketch-retain-text-color.sketchplugin

## Usage

From now on, when you apply text styles any associated colours will be retained. To prevent this behaviour simply disable the plugin via `Plugins > Manage Plugins...`
